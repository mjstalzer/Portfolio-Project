# Portfolio-Project
        Homework 2

* This project focussed on creating a responsive webpage that to accomodate various screen sizes.

    *  I started by matcing each page to its respective 980px wireframe.

    * I created main themes shared among the wireframe pictures which allowed me to contain one css file that I applied to each html file.

    * I used bootstrap elements and implemented Bootstrap's grid system for the positioning of the main elements on each page.

        * Bootstrap has some 'built-in' responsiveness. I had to use what they provided as a template to form what I needed.

    * From there, I had to use media queries to make the site look more appealing as the screen size got smaller. 

    * This project highlighted the usefulness/importance of the inspector tool.
