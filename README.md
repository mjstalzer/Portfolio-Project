# Portfolio-Project
Homework 2

* This project focussed on creating a webpage that adapts to different screen sizes.

* I started by matcing each page to its respective 980px wireframe.

* I used bootstrap elements and implemented Bootstrap's grid system for the positioning of the main elements on each page.

* From there, I had to use media queries to make the site look more appealing as the screen size got smaller.
